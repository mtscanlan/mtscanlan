					<h1>Summary</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p class="description">My non-uniform path to software development and people leadership has led me through a number of varied experiences both in school and in the worplace. I have an advanced diploma from Fanshawe College in the field of Computer Programming, graduating with distinction by achieving the Presidents Honor Roll. I am interested in health and fitness, the automotive industry, and the video game industry. My interest in these fields has led me from apprenticing as an automotive mechanic, to studying for three years at McMaster University in Mechatronics Engineering, and finally graduating from Fanshawe College.</p>
					
					<p class="description">During my time at Fanshawe College, I had the opportunity to spend my co-op terms at Quantica Trading, an algorithmic trading company, and was extended a job offer post-graduation. I found myself unexpectedly unemployed late in 2014 when the company closed, but was able to quickly find work as a Software Developer at Igloo Software where I developed and maintained an enterprise web application. In 2017, I joined FleetCarma as a Software Developer, and after a few months was offered the opportunity to lead one of the sprint teams. I am currently responsible for guiding (and sometimes being guided by) an amazing team of developers and quality analysts, tasked with building and maintaining the logic tier of a telematics platform.</p>

					<p class="description">My typical day-to-day has me wearing many hats. In the mornings, evenings, and on weekends, I am both husband and father. At work I frequently switch between (but am not limited to) developer, architect, product manager, QA lead, goal setter, life coach, and sometimes therapist. I'm thankful that I have been given the opportunity to work alongside such a great team of people. People leadership has been a difficult but rewarding experience for me, and I welcome the limitless challenges that come with it.</p>
