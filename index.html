					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am currently working as a Software Development Team Lead at FleetCarma, where I develop within the logic tier of a telematics platform utilizing advanced frameworks and technologies. Prior to FleetCarma, I worked at Igloo Software where I developed and maintained an enterprise web application, and Quantica Trading before that, where I worked to develop an algorithmic trading platform.</p>
					<p>I have an advanced diploma from Fanshawe College in the field of Computer Programming, graduating with distinction by achieving the Presidents Honor Roll. I am interested in health and fitness, the automotive industry, and the video game industry. My interest in these fields has led me from apprenticing as an automotive mechanic, to studying for three years at McMaster University in Mechatronics Engineering, and finally graduating from Fanshawe College. This diverse educational and work experience has provided me with a unique combination of technical and hands-on knowledge for computer systems and programming. It has helped teach me about the benefits of teamwork in my field, and has led to the successful development of several systems and components.</p>
